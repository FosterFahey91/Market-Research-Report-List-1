<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber is produced primarily through two spinning techniques: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving PAN in a solvent and extruding it into a coagulation bath, where the fiber solidifies, leading to high strength and modulus properties. Dry spinning, on the other hand, uses a solvent to dissolve PAN, which is then extruded into a heated air chamber where the solvent evaporates, forming fibers. Both methods offer unique characteristics, catering to diverse applications in textiles and advanced materials.</p></p>
