<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine SOx Scrubber System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Marine SOx Scrubber System market consists of three main types: Open Loop Scrubbers, Closed Loop Scrubbers, and Hybrid Scrubbers. Open Loop Scrubbers use seawater to remove sulfur oxides and discharge treated water back into the ocean. Closed Loop Scrubbers, on the other hand, recirculate water mixed with sodium hydroxide, neutralizing SOx emissions without discharging into the sea. Hybrid Scrubbers can operate in both modes, adapting to regulatory environments and vessel operating conditions for optimal performance.</p></p>
