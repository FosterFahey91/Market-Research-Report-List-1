<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIRF Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prism Method</li><li>Objective Lens Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopes utilize two primary methods: the prism method and the objective lens method. The prism method involves directing laser light through a prism, which creates an evanescent wave at the sample interface, enhancing fluorescence signal from nearby specimens. In contrast, the objective lens method employs an objective lens to create the evanescent field, allowing for high-resolution imaging of thin regions close to the substrate. Both techniques are essential for studying cellular processes at the nanoscale.</p></p>
