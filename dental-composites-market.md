<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Composites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental composites market is divided into direct and indirect types. Direct composites are applied chairside, allowing for immediate restoration of cavities or defects, typically used in fillings. They offer quick results and fewer appointments. Indirect composites, on the other hand, require laboratory processing, as they are fabricated outside the mouth and then bonded in place. This method is often used for more complex restorations like crowns and bridges, providing enhanced durability and esthetics.</p></p>
