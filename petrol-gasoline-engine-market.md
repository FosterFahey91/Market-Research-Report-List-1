<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petrol (Gasoline) Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2 Stroke</li><li>4 Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The petrol engine market primarily comprises two types: 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines. 2-stroke engines are smaller, lighter, and provide power with every revolution, making them ideal for applications like motorcycles and chainsaws. However, they are less fuel-efficient and produce more emissions. In contrast, 4-stroke engines are more common in automobiles, offering better fuel efficiency and lower emissions due to their four phases of operation: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This makes them suitable for a wide range of vehicles.</p></p>
