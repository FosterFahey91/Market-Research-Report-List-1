<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Scooter Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubeless Tires</li><li>Tubed Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric scooter tire market primarily features two types: tubeless and tubed tires. Tubeless tires lack an inner tube, offering better puncture resistance, reduced weight, and improved ride comfort due to lower air pressure. They are more durable and require less maintenance. Tubed tires, on the other hand, use an inner tube to hold air, making them easier and cheaper to repair or replace. However, they are more prone to punctures and require frequent maintenance, making them less efficient for long-term use.</p></p>
