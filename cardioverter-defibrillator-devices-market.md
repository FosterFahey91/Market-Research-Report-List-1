<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardioverter Defibrillator Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li><li>External Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardioverter defibrillator devices market is primarily categorized into two types: implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and external cardioverter defibrillators. ICDs are surgically placed within the body to monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks when necessary, providing continuous cardiac support for patients with arrhythmias. In contrast, external cardioverter defibrillators, including automated external defibrillators (AEDs), are portable devices used in emergency situations to restore normal heart rhythm by delivering shocks externally. Both play crucial roles in managing cardiac emergencies and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
