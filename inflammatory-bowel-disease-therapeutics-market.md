<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-inflammatory Biologics</li><li>Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li><li>Corticosteroids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) therapeutics market includes various treatment categories. Anti-inflammatory biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies, target specific immune responses to reduce inflammation in diseases like Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) alleviate pain and inflammation without steroids, but they may exacerbate IBD in some patients. Corticosteroids provide rapid relief by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammation effectively but often with potential side effects for long-term use. Together, these therapies cater to diverse patient needs in managing IBD.</p></p>
